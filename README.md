# TRAX LRS 2.0 - Starter Edition


## About TRAX LRS

TRAX LRS is an xAPI conformant Learning Record Store (LRS) built with Laravel.

It focuses on the core features of an LRS, and that's it!

We want to keep it simple and clean, and give you the freedom to build what you want around it.

## Upgrade from previous versions

### From beta4, beta5 and rc1

You can keep and migrate your beta4, beta5 and rc1 database. Install the application,
configure the database in the `.env` file, then run `php artisan migrate`.
Of course, this is your responsability to make all the necessary backups and checks.

### From older versions

The database schema has changed since beta4 and there is no migration.
So we recommend installing a fresh application with a fresh database.


## Fresh install

### First Steps

Assuming that you want to install TRAX LRS in a folder named **traxlrs**:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/trax-project/trax2-starter-lrs traxlrs
cd traxlrs
composer install
```

### File Permissions

Folders `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` require write access by the web server.
If you are not sure how to configure this, you can use the following commands **for testing purpose**.

```
chmod -R 777 bootstrap/cache
chmod -R 777 storage
```

### Web Server

For security reasons, only the `public` folder should be accessible by the web server.
Create a virtual host and configure the document root to `traxlrs/public`.


### Database

Create an empty database with the `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` encoding.
Then, at the root of the application folder, make a copy of the `.env.example` file,
rename it `.env` and enter your database settings.

*MySQL/MariaDB example:*

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=traxlrs
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

*PostgreSQL example:*

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=traxlrs
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=aaaaaa
```

### App URL

In the `.env` file, you must set the public URL of your TRAX LRS application :

```ini
APP_URL=http://traxlrs.test
```

### Last Steps

```
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```


## Admin Account

You can now create an admin account with the following command.
This will give your credentials to log into the application.

```
php artisan admin:create
```

Additional commands are available to manage the admin accounts:

```powershell
php artisan admin:list
php artisan admin:update
php artisan admin:delete
```


## Production server

In the `.env` file, changes settings from:

```ini
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
```

To:

```ini
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
```

To optimize performances, you can run the following commands.

```powershell
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
```

The `php artisan config:cache` command must be ran again after each config change.


## Minor updates

You can get the last minor updates with the following commands:

```
git pull origin master
git submodule update
composer dumpautoload
```
